== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. After installation, I always get the configuration screen. How can I get past it? =

A. Please make sure the file and folder permissions are set correctly. The webserver use has to be able to write into the /wp-content/ folder. 

= Q. When I save a form I get a "catchable fatal error". What to do? =

A. This is most likely a permission issue. Please make sure to apply the appropriate rights to your files and folders. You can also try to 777 the folder /wp-content/breezingforms/ajax_cache/ (or create it if it doesn't exist). Please revert the permissions once you are sure that this was the reason.

= Q. My form doesn't send emails. What did I do wrong? =

A. Most likely nothing. Please go to BreezingForms => Configuration => and enable SMTP. The default PHP email system often causes trouble. Usually, SMTP works best. Also make sure you enter the SMTP login and server data correctly (if required by the server) and that you give a proper Mailfrom address. Also make sure that email notifications are enabled in your form.

= Q. I am pretty sure the permissions on my server are correct, but I still can't get past the setup screen (or still getting "catchable fatal error"). What else can I do? =

A. If not exists, create the folder /wp-content/breezingforms/. Inside that folder, create an empty file called "facileforms.process.php". Open BreezingForms again and see if you can get past the setup this time. If you still get "catchable fatal error", try the FTP layer settings in the facileforms.config.php. The FTP can help fixing permission issues.

= Q. Where do I find uploaded files? =

A. By default, all uploads go into /wp-content/breezingforms/uploads/. You can change the upload folder in the main configuration or for each upload element in its advanced configuration.

= Q. Where do I put a form theme? =

A. All themes go into the folder /wp-content/breezingforms/themes/. After that, the theme will be available from the theme selection in the form editor.

= Q. I want to edit the appearance of the PDF. How can I do that? =

A. You find the templates for the PDFs in /wp-content/breezingforms/pdftpl/. One template is for record exports, the other for attachments.
